            <p>A Reuters report said arrest warrants were issued in the United States for Gautam Adani and his nephew Sagar Adani, after a grand jury in New York indicted the business tycoon and seven others on charges of bribery of $265 million (around Rs 2,029 crore) on Wednesday (November 20).

                Lisa H Miller, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, accused Adani and his associates of bribing Indian government officials and conspiring to obtain lucrative solar energy supply contracts “through corruption and fraud at the expense of US investors”.

                China on Monday said it stands ready to deliver on important common understandings reached between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the recent BRICS summit leading to a thaw in the relations frozen for over four years due to a military standoff in Eastern Ladakh.
                
                “Recently, President Xi Jinping met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the margins of the BRICS summit held in Kazan,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a media briefing here while responding to a question on the likelihood of a meeting the two leaders on the sidelines of G20 summit in Brazil.</p>

         Published:November 23 2024
         <div class="content">
        <p>IND vs AUS: Jaiswal, the batsman who has battered all bowlers in India, in West Indies, but couldn’t replicate it on tough Test pitches in South Africa - his only real blip so to say - has taken that big step in Australia.</p>

            <p>Yashasvi Jaiswal’s batting is firstly functional; secondly personal; and lastly, occasionally artistic. Australia saw all three traits during his unbeaten 90 that propelled India to a position of immense strength in the first Test at Perth.
